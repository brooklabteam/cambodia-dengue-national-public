# This folder contains the script to generate figure 1

The main script is "fig1.R". It generates all four subplots a-d. You can find the final figure fig1.png in the folder "final-figures". Additionally, there is a script ("figS1.R") to produce Fig S1 from the supplement -- this is simply a visualization of national trends in birth and death rates and total population for Cambodia across the duration of our 18 year time series.

## Input files for "fig1.R"
The "make-tsir-data.R" builds the TSIR-structured data.
The "generate-combined-tsir-increased-S-increased-beta-dataset.R" fits all the TSIR models and builds the datasets that are called for plotting.
